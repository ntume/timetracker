The time tracker app was designed to collect time-use data for scientific
research. The Android application allows users to input the time spent on
activities during a day by clicking on one or two listed activities. The
activities are represented pictorially. The Application was designed and
tested by a team led by Dr Thomas Daum
(https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/thomasdaum) of the Program of
Accompanying Research for Agricultural Innovation
(https://research4agrinnovation.org/).
